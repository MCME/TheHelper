Tracks for new players, and sends valuable information to them, such as the location of the forums, where to find the texturepacks, TeamSpeak and how to use it, ...
Also is used to supply developers with various statistics and debug information.

- Checks if the player is a new player or not by verifying if there's a valid profile within the world folder.
- If no profile was found, it broadcasts a message server wide informing everyone that the player is new.
- The new player will receive various information on his first join, such as a link to the forum, and pointing out that Guides are there to help/assist new players.
